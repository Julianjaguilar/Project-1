Project Description: The goal of this project was to create a web app, that met the following criteria:
    * Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap(Bootstrap will be used as well).
    * Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
    * Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
    * Use at least two server side apis.
    * Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
    * Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
    * Be responsive.
    * Have a polished UI.
    * Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
    * Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

Use Case: This type of web application will utiilize 2 different server side API's (Walk Score & TomTom), along with 2 different CSS Frameworks (BootStrap and Pure). The goal of this web application is to provide users with a visual map of an input location as well as generate a WalkScore for that location as well. The WalkScore is based off of the walkability, public transit options and bike pathways presented in a given area.

    * When a user opens the website, 
    * When the user inputs an address, zip code, city or state,
